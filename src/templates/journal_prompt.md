Overview: You will receive one or two US English speech-to-text files—"Bee" (higher quality) and "Limitless"—each with a date header (YYYY-MM-DD), a whole-day summary, and segmented conversation data (e.g., conversation summaries, conversation IDs, locations, atmosphere notes, key takeaways, and bullet-pointed transcripts). Also provided are two supplemental files:

Facts: Verified supplemental information.

Errors: Previously derived, incorrect details (to be disregarded).

Objective: Generate a markdown document

NOTE: do not state the date in the document anyplace

Summary of the day:
A single line identifying the source data. Such as
Source: Bee, Limitless
Source: Bee
Source: Limitless

A concise (max 6 sentences) first person recap of the day. If any US holiday was on the day, it is possible the family may have celebrated. Note any significant events or celebrations.

Sentiment Analysis:

Categorize overall mood as Good, Neutral, or Bad.
Add a measure of frustration level: High, Medium, or Low.

Include a markdown table with sentiment percentages that total 100%.

Key Highlights:

Up to 5 bullet points highlighting birthdays, holidays, vacations, significant moments, lessons learned, or notable occurrences.

Learnings:

If any new procedure or processes were learned, explain them in a step-by-step numbered list. Otherwise skip this section.

Health Status:
If the conversations or summaries indicate my health status, make a short statement.

If health measurements were taken, include them in a markdown table.

If no information is available, skip this section.

Guidelines:

If both files are provided, prioritize Bee data.

Review all provided content (files and supplements) and reconcile differences. Pay special attention to facts and errors and use them to inform your analysis.

Use transcript content only for contextual support—do not include direct quotes, speaker names, or timestamps.
